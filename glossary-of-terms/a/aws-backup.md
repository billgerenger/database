# AWS Backup

### Definition

AWS Backup is a backup and recovery solution offered by Amazon Web Services (AWS) that allows customers to protect their AWS resources, such as Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instances, Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS) databases, and Amazon DynamoDB tables.

### Explanation

AWS Backup is a fully-managed service that enables customers to create and manage backups of their AWS resources using a centralized, web-based console. Customers can create backup policies, set retention periods, and automate backups for their resources. AWS Backup supports incremental backups, which can help reduce backup costs and improve backup performance.

AWS Backup also provides features such as point-in-time recovery, cross-region backup, and backup compliance reporting. Customers can use AWS Backup to restore their AWS resources to a previous state in the event of data loss or corruption, and to comply with regulatory or business requirements related to data protection.
