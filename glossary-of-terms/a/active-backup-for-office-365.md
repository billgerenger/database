Active Backup for Office 365 is a backup and recovery solution that allows businesses to protect their Office 365 data, including emails, contacts, calendars, and OneDrive for Business files.

### Explanation

Active Backup for Office 365 is a software application developed by Synology, a provider of network-attached storage (NAS) devices. The solution allows businesses to create backups of their Office 365 data and store the backups on a Synology NAS or other storage device.
