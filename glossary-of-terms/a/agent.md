# Agent

### Definition

An agent is a software component that is installed on a system or device to perform specific tasks, such as backup and recovery operations, on behalf of a backup software or data protection solution.

### Explanation

An agent typically runs as a background process on a system or device and communicates with the backup software or data protection solution to perform tasks such as file-level backups, system backups, and application backups. Agents may also perform other tasks, such as data compression, encryption, and deduplication, to optimize backup and recovery operations.

Agents are commonly used in enterprise environments where multiple systems and devices need to be backed up and managed centrally. Agents may be installed on servers, workstations, laptops, and mobile devices to ensure that all data is protected and can be restored in the event of a disaster or data loss.

Agents can be managed and configured through a centralized management console provided by the backup software or data protection solution. This allows administrators to monitor backup and recovery operations, schedule backups, and configure agent settings across multiple systems and devices.
