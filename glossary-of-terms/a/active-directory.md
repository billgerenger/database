# Active Directory

### Definition

Active Directory (AD) is a directory service developed by Microsoft that stores information about network resources, such as users, computers, and applications, and provides a centralized authentication and authorization mechanism for accessing these resources.

### Explanation

Active Directory is a hierarchical and distributed database that organizes network resources into a logical structure, called a domain, and provides a set of services, including user authentication, authorization, and policy enforcement. Active Directory is used primarily in Windows-based environments and is widely deployed in enterprise organizations.

Active Directory provides a single sign-on (SSO) experience for users, allowing them to use the same username and password to access multiple resources on the network. Active Directory also provides a range of security features, such as password policies, group policies, and audit logging, that help protect network resources from unauthorized access or modification.

Active Directory can be backed up and restored using a variety of backup solutions, such as Microsoft's built-in Windows Server Backup or third-party backup software. Backing up Active Directory is important for ensuring business continuity in the event of a disaster or data loss.
