# Hot Backup

### Definition

Hot Backup, also known as Online Backup, refers to a backup method that allows data to be backed up while the system or application is still running and serving users. It ensures continuous data availability and minimizes downtime during the backup process.

### Explanation

Hot Backup is a backup technique that enables data to be backed up without interrupting the normal operation of the system or application. It is particularly useful for environments that require high availability and cannot afford significant downtime for backup operations.

Here's how Hot Backup typically works:

1. Live Backup: Hot Backup takes place while the system or application is in active use, serving users and processing data. It captures data changes and updates in real-time, ensuring that the backup is up-to-date and reflects the most recent state of the data.
2. Transaction Consistency: Hot Backup ensures transaction consistency by employing techniques that guarantee the integrity and completeness of ongoing transactions during the backup process. This ensures that the backup captures a consistent snapshot of the data, avoiding data corruption or incomplete backups.
3. Incremental Backup: Hot Backup often utilizes an incremental backup approach, where only the changes or differences since the last backup are captured and stored. This minimizes the backup time and storage requirements, as only the modified or new data needs to be processed and transferred.
4. Backup Agents or APIs: Hot Backup may require the use of backup agents or application programming interfaces (APIs) provided by the system or application being backed up. These agents or APIs facilitate the capture and transfer of data during the live backup process.

Benefits of Hot Backup include:

* Continuous Data Availability: Hot Backup ensures that critical systems and applications remain accessible and functional during the backup process. Users can continue their operations without experiencing significant interruptions or downtime.
* Reduced Impact on Productivity: By allowing backups to occur while the system is live, Hot Backup minimizes the impact on productivity and business operations. It avoids the need for system downtime or service interruptions for backup purposes.
* Real-Time Data Protection: Hot Backup captures data changes in real-time, providing up-to-date backups that reflect the latest state of the data. This helps minimize data loss in case of failures or disasters.

### Related terms

* Cold Backup: In contrast to Hot Backup, Cold Backup involves taking a backup when the system or application is offline or not actively serving users. Cold Backup requires system downtime and may result in temporary service unavailability.
* Incremental Backup: An incremental backup captures and stores only the changes or differences since the last backup. Hot Backup often utilizes incremental backup techniques to minimize backup time and storage requirements.
* Data Availability: Data availability refers to the accessibility and usability of data at any given time. Hot Backup ensures continuous data availability by allowing backups to occur while the system is live and serving users.
* Backup Agents: Backup agents are software components or modules installed on the system or application being backed up. They facilitate the backup process by interacting with the system, capturing data changes, and transferring data to the backup storage.
* API (Application Programming Interface): APIs are interfaces that allow different software applications to communicate and interact with each other. Hot Backup may utilize APIs provided by the system or application to capture and transfer data during the live backup process.
