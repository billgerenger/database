# Hybrid Backup

### Definition

Hybrid Backup refers to a data protection approach that combines both local backup and cloud backup strategies to create a comprehensive backup solution. It leverages the advantages of local storage for fast backups and recoveries, while utilizing cloud storage for off-site data protection and disaster recovery.

### Explanation

Hybrid Backup combines the benefits of local backup and cloud backup to create a hybrid data protection strategy. It offers a versatile and robust backup solution that addresses the need for both quick data recovery and off-site data protection.

Here's how Hybrid Backup typically works:

1. Local Backup: In a Hybrid Backup approach, data is initially backed up to local storage infrastructure, such as on-premises servers, network-attached storage (NAS) devices, or external hard drives. Local backup provides fast backup and recovery capabilities, allowing for quick data restoration in case of minor data loss incidents or system failures.
2. Cloud Backup: In addition to local backup, Hybrid Backup utilizes cloud storage as a secondary backup destination. Data is periodically replicated or synced to a cloud-based backup service or provider. Cloud backup offers advantages such as off-site data protection, scalability, data redundancy, and disaster recovery capabilities.
3. Backup Synchronization: Hybrid Backup solutions synchronize data between the local backup infrastructure and the cloud backup service. This synchronization ensures that changes made to the data are reflected in both the local backup and the cloud backup, maintaining data consistency and providing an up-to-date backup copy in both locations.
4. Granular Recovery: Hybrid Backup solutions typically support granular recovery, allowing users to restore individual files, folders, or application data from either the local backup or the cloud backup. This flexibility enables efficient and targeted data recovery, minimizing downtime and ensuring business continuity.

Benefits of Hybrid Backup include:

* Faster Recovery: Local backup allows for quick data restoration from local storage, ensuring minimal downtime and faster recovery in case of data loss or system failure.
* Off-site Data Protection: Cloud backup provides an additional layer of protection by storing a copy of the data in a remote location. This safeguards against localized disasters, such as fire, theft, or hardware failures, ensuring data availability even if the local backup infrastructure is compromised.
* Scalability: Cloud backup offers scalability, allowing organizations to easily expand their backup storage capacity as their data grows. It eliminates the need for upfront hardware investments and provides flexibility to accommodate changing backup storage requirements.
* Disaster Recovery: Hybrid Backup facilitates disaster recovery by leveraging the cloud backup for off-site data replication and recovery. In the event of a major disaster or site-wide failure, organizations can restore data from the cloud backup to alternative locations or systems, ensuring business continuity.

### Related terms

* Local Backup: The process of creating backup copies of data onto local storage infrastructure, such as on-premises servers, NAS devices, or external hard drives. Local backup provides fast backup and recovery capabilities.
* Cloud Backup: The process of backing up data to a remote, cloud-based storage service or provider. Cloud backup offers off-site data protection, scalability, and disaster recovery capabilities.
* Off-site Backup: Storing backup copies of data in a location separate from the primary data source. Cloud backup is a form of off-site backup, providing data redundancy and protection against localized disasters.
* Disaster Recovery (DR): The process and set of strategies for recovering and restoring data and IT infrastructure after a significant disruptive event. Hybrid Backup plays a crucial role in disaster recovery by providing both local and off-site backup options.
* Granular Recovery: The ability to restore individual files, folders, or application data from a backup. Hybrid Backup solutions typically support granular recovery from both the local backup and the cloud backup.
