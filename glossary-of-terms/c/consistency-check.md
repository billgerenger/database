# Consistency check

### Definition

A consistency check, also known as a data validation check, is a process used to ensure that data being backed up or stored is consistent and accurate. It involves comparing the data being backed up or stored to a known good copy to identify any discrepancies or errors.

### Explanation

A consistency check is typically performed as part of a backup or storage process to ensure that the data being backed up or stored is accurate and can be successfully restored in case of data loss or corruption. The process involves comparing the data being backed up or stored to a known good copy, which can be either a previous backup or an original data source.

The consistency check can identify a variety of issues, such as missing data, corrupt files, or data that has been modified since the last backup. Depending on the backup or storage solution being used, the consistency check may be performed automatically as part of the backup process, or it may need to be initiated manually.
