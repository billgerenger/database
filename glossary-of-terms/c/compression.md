# Compression

### Definition

Compression is a technique used in data backup and storage to reduce the amount of space required to store data. It involves encoding data using an algorithm that removes redundant or repeated data patterns, resulting in a smaller data size that can be stored more efficiently.

### Explanation

Compression can be applied to a variety of data types, including text, images, audio, and video. It is typically used in data backup and storage solutions to reduce the amount of space required to store data, which can save on storage costs and improve performance.

There are two main types of compression: lossless compression and lossy compression. Lossless compression preserves all of the original data, while lossy compression sacrifices some data quality in exchange for a smaller file size.

In the context of data backup and storage, compression can be applied at various stages of the backup process, including during the initial backup, during incremental backups, and during archiving.

### Related terms

* Deduplication: A technique used to eliminate redundant data within a backup or storage environment, reducing the amount of storage required.
* Backup compression ratio: A measure of the amount of data that can be compressed in a backup job, expressed as a ratio of the original data size to the compressed data size.
* Compression algorithm: The specific method used to compress data, which can vary depending on the type of data being compressed and the desired compression ratio.
* Data archiving: The process of moving data to a separate storage location for long-term retention and compliance purposes.
* Data backup: The process of copying and storing data for the purpose of recovery in case of data loss or corruption.
