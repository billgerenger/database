# Cold Backup

### Definition

A cold backup, also known as an offline backup, is a type of backup that involves backing up data while the system is not running. It typically involves shutting down the system, making a copy of the data, and then storing the copy in a secure location.

### Explanation

A cold backup is often used as a backup strategy when data cannot be backed up while the system is running, or when a complete backup of the system is required. This may be necessary in situations where the system is running critical applications that cannot be interrupted during backup, or where the system is being decommissioned and needs to be archived.

Because a cold backup requires the system to be shut down, it can be time-consuming and disruptive. However, it offers several advantages, including the ability to create a complete backup of the system, reduced risk of data corruption or loss, and the ability to store the backup copy in a secure location, such as an offsite data center.
