# Continuous Data Protection (CDP)

### Definition

Continuous Data Protection (CDP) is a backup and recovery technique that captures and tracks data changes in real-time. It involves the continuous replication of data to a secondary storage location, allowing organizations to recover data to any point in time.

### Explanation

Unlike traditional backup methods, which typically rely on periodic snapshots or incremental backups, CDP offers a more granular approach to data protection. It captures every change made to a file or database, providing a complete history of changes that can be used for recovery purposes.

CDP can be implemented in a variety of ways, including software-based solutions that capture changes at the file system or application level, and hardware-based solutions that use specialized hardware to capture changes at the disk level. CDP can also be deployed on-premises, in the cloud, or in a hybrid environment.

One of the primary benefits of CDP is that it minimizes data loss by allowing organizations to recover data to any point in time, rather than just to the last backup. This can be especially important for organizations with high-value data that cannot afford to lose any changes or transactions.
