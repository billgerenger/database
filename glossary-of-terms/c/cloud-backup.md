# Cloud Backup

### Definition

Cloud backup is a type of data backup that uses cloud storage to store and protect data. It involves copying data from an organization's systems to a cloud-based backup service provider's infrastructure, where it can be securely stored and easily recovered in the event of a disaster.

### Explanation

Cloud backup provides several benefits over traditional backup methods, such as tape or disk-based backups. For example, it eliminates the need for an organization to purchase and maintain backup hardware and software, and it allows data to be backed up and recovered from any location with an internet connection.

Cloud backup also provides greater flexibility and scalability, as organizations can easily increase or decrease their backup capacity as their data storage needs change. It also provides enhanced security and data protection, as data is encrypted during transit and at rest in the cloud.

To implement cloud backup, an organization typically selects a cloud backup service provider and installs an agent on their systems to facilitate the backup and recovery process. The backup schedule and retention policy are typically managed by the service provider, although the organization may have some control over these settings.
