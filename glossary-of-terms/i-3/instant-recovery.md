# Local Backup

### Definition

Local Backup, in the context of backup and recovery, refers to the practice of creating and storing data copies on-site or in close proximity to the source system or device. It involves keeping backup data within the same physical location or local network, providing quick access and reducing reliance on remote or external resources for recovery.

### Explanation

Local Backup is a fundamental component of backup and recovery strategies, offering several benefits for data protection and availability. With Local Backup, organizations create duplicate copies of their data and store them in the same physical location or within the local network infrastructure. This approach ensures that backup data is readily accessible and can be quickly restored in case of data loss or system failures.

By keeping backup data locally, organizations reduce their reliance on external resources or internet connectivity for recovery purposes. This can be advantageous in scenarios where accessing remote backup repositories or cloud-based storage may not be feasible due to limited bandwidth, connectivity issues, or specific compliance requirements.

Local Backup provides faster data recovery times since the backup copies are readily available within the same physical proximity. In case of data loss or system failures, organizations can restore data from the local backup repository without the need to transfer large amounts of data over the network. This can significantly reduce downtime and minimize the impact on business operations.

However, it's important to note that relying solely on Local Backup has its limitations. In the event of a catastrophic event or site-wide disaster, such as fire, flood, or physical damage to the infrastructure, local backups may also be compromised. To mitigate this risk, organizations often employ additional off-site or remote backup strategies to ensure data redundancy and disaster recovery preparedness.

### Related terms

* Off-Site Backup: The practice of storing backup copies in a remote or off-site location, separate from the primary data source.
* Cloud Backup: The process of backing up data to remote cloud-based storage infrastructure, providing off-site redundancy and accessibility.
* Data Redundancy: The duplication of data to ensure multiple copies exist, minimizing the risk of data loss or system failures.
* Recovery Point Objective (RPO): The desired maximum acceptable data loss, indicating the point in time to which data needs to be recovered.
* Recovery Time Objective (RTO): The desired timeframe within which systems or data must be restored after a failure.

Local Backup offers the advantage of quick data recovery and reduced dependency on external resources. By storing backup copies on-site or within the local network, organizations can quickly restore data in case of data loss or system failures. However, it's essential to consider off-site backups for comprehensive data redundancy and disaster recovery preparedness.
