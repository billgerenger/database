# Media Rotation

### Definition

Media Rotation, in the context of backup and recovery, refers to the process of systematically rotating backup media, such as tapes or disks, to ensure proper data retention, mitigate the risk of media failure, and facilitate reliable data recovery.

### Explanation

Media Rotation plays a crucial role in backup and recovery practices by establishing a structured approach to managing backup media. It involves the periodic rotation of backup media, typically tapes or disks, to ensure long-term data retention and minimize the potential impact of media failures.

The primary goal of Media Rotation is to maintain multiple sets of backup media that are regularly cycled and stored in different locations. This practice helps mitigate the risks associated with media deterioration, hardware failures, or environmental hazards that could compromise the integrity and availability of backed-up data.

By rotating backup media, organizations can distribute the workload across different media, reducing the wear and tear on individual devices and extending their lifespan. Additionally, it allows for offline storage of backup media in secure and separate locations, safeguarding against disasters, theft, or other events that could impact the primary backup infrastructure.

Media Rotation strategies vary depending on the specific requirements and retention policies of an organization. Common approaches include daily, weekly, or monthly rotation cycles, where each cycle involves the use of a new set of backup media while the previous set is safely stored offsite. This rotation pattern ensures that multiple generations of backups are retained, enabling point-in-time recovery and providing historical data versions if needed.

Another aspect of Media Rotation is the regular testing and verification of backup media integrity. This involves performing periodic checks to ensure the reliability and recoverability of the stored data. By verifying the integrity of backup media, organizations can identify and address any issues or errors before they impact the ability to restore critical data.

### Related terms

* Backup Retention: The duration for which backup data is retained based on organizational policies, regulatory requirements, and business needs.
* Offsite Storage: The practice of storing backup media in a separate location from the primary backup infrastructure to ensure data protection against physical threats or disasters.
* Backup Verification: The process of validating the integrity and recoverability of backup data by performing periodic tests and checks.
* Media Failure: The occurrence of hardware or media-related issues that render the backup media unreadable or unusable.
* Point-in-Time Recovery: The ability to restore data to a specific moment in time, typically achieved by having multiple generations of backups through rotation and retention.

Media Rotation is a critical component of backup and recovery strategies, ensuring proper data retention, protection against media failure, and reliable data recovery. By systematically rotating backup media and storing them in separate locations, organizations can mitigate risks, extend the lifespan of media, and maintain the ability to recover critical data in the event of system failures or data loss incidents.
