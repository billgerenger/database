# Kept Versions

### Definition

Kept Versions, in the context of backup and recovery, refer to the preserved copies of data or files from various points in time. These versions are retained to provide options for recovering specific versions of data or files based on specific requirements or scenarios.

### Explanation

Kept Versions play a crucial role in backup and recovery processes by allowing organizations to restore data or files to specific points in time. When performing backups, multiple versions of data or files are retained, capturing changes made over time. These versions are stored in a backup repository or storage system, ensuring their availability for recovery purposes.

The retention of multiple versions serves several purposes. First, it provides a historical record of data or file changes, allowing organizations to roll back to a previous state if needed. This is especially valuable in situations where data corruption, accidental deletion, or unauthorized modifications occur, as organizations can restore a clean and unaltered version of the data.

Second, kept versions enable organizations to meet various regulatory or compliance requirements. Depending on the industry or data sensitivity, regulations may dictate the retention of data for specific periods. By retaining multiple versions, organizations can ensure compliance with these requirements and have the ability to restore data as it existed at specific points in time for audit or legal purposes.

Recovering specific versions of data or files from kept versions typically involves accessing the backup repository or storage system and selecting the desired version based on timestamps or other identifiers. The backup and recovery software or tools used in the process facilitate this selection and restoration, ensuring the accuracy and integrity of the recovered data or files.
