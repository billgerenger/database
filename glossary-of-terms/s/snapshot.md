# Snapshot

### Definition

A snapshot is a point-in-time copy of data that captures the state of a file system, disk, or virtual machine (VM) at a specific moment. It serves as a read-only, incremental backup that allows for quick data recovery, system-level restores, and the preservation of data integrity.

### Explanation

Snapshots offer several key benefits and functionalities in backup and recovery processes:

1. Data Protection and Recovery: Snapshots provide a reliable mechanism for data protection by creating point-in-time copies of data. They capture the state of the data at the moment the snapshot is taken, allowing for quick recovery in case of data loss, accidental deletion, or system failures. With snapshots, organizations can easily revert to a previous state of data, minimizing the impact of disruptions and reducing downtime.
2. Efficient Backup Method: Snapshots offer an efficient approach to backup operations. Instead of creating full backups every time, snapshots only capture the changes made since the previous snapshot or initial baseline. This incremental approach saves time and storage space by reducing the amount of data that needs to be backed up during subsequent snapshot operations.
3. Rapid System-Level Restores: Snapshots enable system-level restores, allowing organizations to quickly recover entire file systems, disks, or virtual machines to a specific point in time. This capability is particularly valuable in scenarios where system-wide issues or data corruption require a full system restore. By leveraging snapshots, organizations can restore critical infrastructure rapidly and minimize the impact on business operations.
4. Data Consistency and Integrity: Snapshots provide a consistent view of data at a specific moment, ensuring data integrity during backup and recovery processes. They create a stable, read-only copy that can be used for various purposes, such as data validation, testing, or reporting, without affecting the live production environment. Snapshots help maintain data consistency and support reliable recovery operations.

### Related terms

* Incremental Backup: A backup method that only captures and stores the changes made since the last backup, reducing backup time and storage requirements.
* Point-in-Time Recovery: The process of restoring data to a specific point in time using a snapshot or backup copy.
* Continuous Data Protection (CDP): A backup method that captures every data change in real-time, providing near-instantaneous recovery points.

Snapshots offer a powerful and efficient approach to data protection and recovery. By capturing point-in-time copies of data, snapshots provide quick restores, system-level recovery, and data integrity. Leveraging snapshots as part of a comprehensive backup strategy helps organizations safeguard critical data, minimize downtime, and maintain business continuity.
