# Write-Once, Read-Many (WORM)

### Definition

Write-Once, Read-Many (WORM) is a data storage technology that allows data to be written only once and then read multiple times. It ensures data immutability, meaning that once data is written, it cannot be modified, overwritten, or deleted, providing a secure and tamper-proof storage solution.

### Explanation

WORM technology is commonly used in various storage systems, such as optical discs, tape storage, and specialized WORM-enabled hard drives. Here's how WORM works and its key characteristics:

1. Immutability: WORM technology enforces strict write protection, preventing any modifications or deletions of data once it is written. This immutability ensures data integrity and preserves the authenticity and reliability of stored information.
2. Compliance and Regulatory Requirements: WORM technology is often employed in industries with stringent compliance regulations, such as finance, healthcare, and legal sectors. It helps organizations meet regulatory requirements for data retention, ensuring that critical records and information are securely stored and cannot be tampered with.
3. Data Archiving and Long-Term Retention: WORM storage is ideal for long-term data archiving and retention purposes. It provides a reliable and durable storage medium for preserving valuable data over extended periods, protecting against data loss, and enabling data retrieval when needed.
4. Data Protection and Security: WORM technology enhances data protection and security by preventing unauthorized access, tampering, or deletion of stored data. It helps safeguard critical information, such as legal documents, financial records, and audit logs, from malicious or accidental alterations.
5. Legal Admissibility: WORM storage is often recognized for its legal admissibility, as it ensures the integrity and authenticity of stored data. In legal and regulatory proceedings, WORM technology helps establish the credibility and verifiability of archived information.

### Related terms
