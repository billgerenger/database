# Workload Mobility

### Definition

Workload mobility refers to the ability to move applications, data, and workloads seamlessly between different IT infrastructure resources, such as physical servers, virtual machines, containers, or cloud environments. It allows organizations to optimize resource utilization, achieve scalability, enhance availability, and adapt to changing business needs.

### Explanation

Workload mobility has become increasingly important in today's dynamic IT landscapes. Here are key aspects and benefits associated with workload mobility:

1. Flexibility and Agility: Workload mobility empowers organizations to flexibly move their applications and data across various infrastructure resources. This flexibility enables them to respond to changing business requirements, allocate resources efficiently, and optimize workload placement based on performance, cost, and specific infrastructure capabilities.
2. Scalability and Resource Optimization: Workload mobility enables organizations to scale their IT infrastructure dynamically. By moving workloads to resources with higher capacity or performance, they can accommodate increased demand, prevent bottlenecks, and achieve optimal resource utilization. Workload mobility also allows for load balancing across multiple resources, distributing workloads evenly to optimize performance and maximize efficiency.
3. High Availability and Disaster Recovery: Workload mobility plays a crucial role in achieving high availability and disaster recovery objectives. By seamlessly transferring workloads and data to redundant or geographically dispersed resources, organizations can ensure continuous availability of critical applications and minimize downtime in the event of hardware failures, network disruptions, or disasters. Workload mobility facilitates failover and disaster recovery processes, enabling rapid restoration of services.
4. Technology Platform Independence: Workload mobility allows applications and workloads to transcend technology platforms. It enables the movement of workloads between different types of infrastructure, including on-premises servers, virtualized environments, private clouds, public clouds, and hybrid cloud configurations. This platform independence reduces vendor lock-in, facilitates hybrid cloud adoption, and enables organizations to choose the most suitable infrastructure resources for specific workloads.
5. Data Migration and Lifecycle Management: Workload mobility simplifies data migration and lifecycle management. It enables the smooth movement of data along with associated applications, ensuring data integrity and consistency during transitions. Organizations can seamlessly migrate workloads and associated data to new infrastructure resources, retire outdated systems, or consolidate resources while maintaining data accessibility and preserving data integrity.

### Related terms

* Application Mobility: Refers specifically to the movement of applications across different infrastructure resources while preserving their functionality and performance characteristics. Application mobility is often a key aspect of workload mobility.
* Live Migration: A technique commonly used in virtualized environments to move running virtual machines from one physical host to another without interrupting their operation. Live migration is a form of workload mobility that ensures continuous availability of applications during the migration process.
* Hybrid Cloud: A cloud computing environment that combines the use of on-premises infrastructure with public and private cloud services. Workload mobility is often essential in hybrid cloud environments to enable seamless movement of workloads between different cloud platforms and on-premises resources.

Workload mobility empowers organizations with flexibility, scalability, and optimization in managing their applications and workloads. By embracing workload mobility, organizations can dynamically adapt to changing demands, achieve resource efficiency, enhance availability, and facilitate effective data migration and lifecycle management.
