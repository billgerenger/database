# Geographically Dispersed Backup

### Definition

Geographically Dispersed Backup refers to a data protection strategy that involves creating backup copies of data in multiple physically separated locations. It aims to mitigate the risk of data loss due to localized disasters or disruptions by ensuring data redundancy across different geographical areas.

### Explanation

Geographically Dispersed Backup, also known as Geo-dispersed Backup or Geo-distributed Backup, is a method of data protection that provides additional resilience and fault tolerance by storing backup copies of data in geographically diverse locations. It is implemented to minimize the impact of localized disasters, such as natural disasters, infrastructure failures, or regional disruptions, that may affect a single data center or location.

Here's how Geographically Dispersed Backup works:

1. Multiple Backup Locations: Geographically Dispersed Backup involves establishing backup infrastructure in multiple physically separated locations. These locations can be in different regions, cities, or even countries, providing a significant distance between them.
2. Replication or Synchronization: Data replication or synchronization mechanisms are employed to ensure that backup copies are consistent and up to date across the geographically dispersed locations. This can be achieved through various methods, such as asynchronous replication, synchronous replication, or periodic synchronization.
3. Redundancy and Resilience: By maintaining backup copies in multiple locations, Geographically Dispersed Backup adds redundancy and resilience to the data protection strategy. If one location experiences a disaster or disruption, the backup copies stored in other locations remain unaffected and can be used for recovery purposes.
4. Data Recovery and Restoration: In the event of a data loss or failure in one location, the backup copies stored in the geographically dispersed locations can be utilized for data recovery and restoration. The data can be retrieved from the unaffected locations, minimizing downtime and ensuring business continuity.

Geographically Dispersed Backup offers several advantages, including:

* Disaster Recovery: It enhances the disaster recovery capabilities by providing data redundancy across different locations, reducing the risk of complete data loss in the event of a localized disaster.
* Data Availability: It improves data availability by ensuring that backup copies are accessible from multiple locations. This increases the chances of retrieving data even if one or more locations are unavailable.
* Business Continuity: Geographically Dispersed Backup supports business continuity efforts by minimizing the impact of localized disruptions or disasters on data availability and recovery. It helps organizations quickly recover and resume their operations.

### Related terms

* Data Replication: The process of creating and maintaining duplicate copies of data in real-time or near-real-time. Data replication is a key component of Geographically Dispersed Backup, ensuring data consistency across different locations.
* Disaster Recovery Planning: The proactive process of creating strategies and plans to recover and restore IT infrastructure and data following a disaster. Geographically Dispersed Backup is often part of the disaster recovery planning to address data protection requirements.
* Redundancy: The practice of duplicating critical components or data to ensure system availability and minimize the impact of failures. Geographically Dispersed Backup adds redundancy to data protection efforts by storing backup copies in multiple locations.
* Business Continuity Planning: The process of developing strategies and procedures to maintain or quickly resume essential business operations during or after a disruption. Geographically Dispersed Backup contributes to business continuity planning by providing data redundancy and minimizing downtime.
* Recovery Time Objective (RTO): The targeted duration within which systems, applications, or data should be recovered following a disruption. Geographically Dispersed Backup can help achieve shorter RTOs by enabling recovery from geographically dispersed backup locations.
* Replication Lag: The time delay between the modification of data in one location and its replication to another location. Replication lag should be considered when implementing Geographically Dispersed Backup to ensure data consistency and minimize data loss.
