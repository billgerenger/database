# Global Deduplication

### Definition

Global Deduplication, also known as Enterprise Deduplication, is a data reduction technique used in backup and storage systems to eliminate duplicate data across multiple sources and locations within an organization. It optimizes storage efficiency by identifying and storing only unique data segments, resulting in reduced storage requirements and improved backup performance.

### Explanation

Global Deduplication is a deduplication technique that goes beyond traditional deduplication methods by identifying and eliminating duplicate data across multiple sources and locations within an organization. It is typically employed in backup and storage systems to minimize storage consumption and optimize backup performance.

Here's how Global Deduplication typically works:

1. Data Segment Identification: Global Deduplication analyzes data segments (blocks, chunks, or files) across various sources and locations, such as servers, endpoints, and backup repositories. It breaks down the data into smaller segments for comparison and identification of duplicate segments.
2. Deduplication Index: A deduplication index or database is maintained to track and store unique data segments. This index contains metadata that helps identify duplicate segments and references to the unique instances of those segments.
3. Duplicate Elimination: When data is backed up or stored, Global Deduplication compares the data segments against the deduplication index. If a segment is identified as a duplicate, only a reference or pointer to the unique instance of that segment is stored, rather than storing the duplicate segment itself. This eliminates redundant storage of duplicate data.
4. Improved Storage Efficiency: Global Deduplication significantly reduces storage requirements by storing only unique data segments. As a result, organizations can optimize their storage capacity and reduce costs associated with additional storage infrastructure.
5. Enhanced Backup Performance: By eliminating duplicate data during backup processes, Global Deduplication improves backup performance. It reduces the amount of data that needs to be transferred and stored, resulting in faster backup windows, reduced network bandwidth utilization, and shorter backup and recovery times.

Global Deduplication offers several benefits, including:

* Storage Optimization: Global Deduplication minimizes storage requirements by eliminating duplicate data across multiple sources and locations. This allows organizations to maximize their storage capacity and potentially reduce costs associated with additional storage systems.
* Bandwidth Efficiency: By reducing the amount of data transferred during backup operations, Global Deduplication optimizes network bandwidth utilization. It helps prevent network congestion and allows organizations to efficiently use their available network resources.
* Faster Backup and Recovery: The elimination of duplicate data segments speeds up backup and recovery processes. It reduces the volume of data that needs to be processed, transmitted, and stored, resulting in shorter backup windows and faster data restoration in case of data loss incidents.

### Related terms

* Deduplication: The process of identifying and eliminating duplicate data within a single source or location. Global Deduplication extends deduplication capabilities to multiple sources and locations, allowing for the identification and elimination of duplicates across an organization.
* Data Reduction: Data reduction techniques, such as deduplication and compression, are employed to minimize storage requirements. Global Deduplication is a form of data reduction that focuses on eliminating duplicate data segments.
* Backup Storage Efficiency: The efficiency with which backup data is stored and managed. Global Deduplication improves backup storage efficiency by reducing the amount of duplicate data stored, optimizing storage utilization, and reducing backup storage costs.
* Backup Performance: The speed and efficiency of backup operations. Global Deduplication enhances backup performance by reducing the amount of data processed, transmitted, and stored, resulting in faster backup windows and improved backup and recovery times.
* Data Segmentation: The process of dividing data into smaller segments, such as blocks, chunks, or files, for storage and analysis purposes. Data segmentation is an essential step in Global Deduplication to identify duplicate data segments across multiple sources and locations.
* Data Integrity: The accuracy, consistency, and reliability of data. Global Deduplication preserves data integrity by ensuring that duplicate data segments are eliminated while maintaining the integrity of unique data segments.
* Deduplication Index: A database or index that stores metadata and references to unique data segments. The deduplication index is used during the deduplication process to identify duplicates and store references to unique instances of data segments.
