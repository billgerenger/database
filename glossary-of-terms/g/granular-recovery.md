# Granular Recovery

### Definition

Granular Recovery refers to the capability of restoring individual files, folders, or application components from a backup or snapshot, rather than performing a complete restoration of the entire system. It allows for selective recovery of specific data elements, providing flexibility and efficiency in data restoration processes.

### Explanation

Granular Recovery refers to the capability of restoring individual files, folders, or application components from a backup or snapshot, rather than performing a complete restoration of the entire system. It allows for selective recovery of specific data elements, providing flexibility and efficiency in data restoration processes.

### Related terms

* Full Restoration: The process of restoring an entire system, dataset, or backup to its original state. Granular Recovery offers an alternative to full restorations by providing selective recovery options.
* Point-in-Time Recovery: The ability to recover data to a specific point in time, often achieved through granular recovery options. It allows organizations to roll back data to a specific state before an issue or data loss occurred.
* Snapshot: A point-in-time copy or image of a system, disk, or data at a particular moment. Granular Recovery can leverage snapshots to enable the restoration of specific data elements without relying on full backups.
* Backup Software: Software solutions designed for creating and managing backups. Backup software often includes granular recovery capabilities as a key feature.
* Data Protection: The practice of safeguarding data from loss, corruption, or unauthorized access. Granular Recovery is an essential component of data protection strategies, allowing for precise restoration of critical data.
* Disaster Recovery: The process and set of strategies for recovering IT infrastructure and data following a significant disruptive event. Granular Recovery plays a role in disaster recovery by enabling selective restoration of specific data elements in a timely manner.
* Data Backup: The process of creating copies of data to protect against data loss or corruption. Granular Recovery complements data backup strategies by offering selective recovery options.
* Recovery Point Objective (RPO): The maximum acceptable amount of data loss in the event of a failure or data loss incident. Granular Recovery contributes to achieving shorter RPOs by allowing for targeted restoration of critical data elements.
