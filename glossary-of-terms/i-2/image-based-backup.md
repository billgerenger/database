# Mirroring

### Definition

Mirroring, in the context of backup and recovery, refers to the practice of creating and maintaining real-time, identical copies of data on separate storage devices or systems. It aims to ensure high availability, data redundancy, and rapid recovery in the event of primary system failures.

### Explanation

Mirroring plays a critical role in backup and recovery strategies by providing data redundancy and enabling quick recovery from system failures. It involves the continuous replication of data from a primary system to a secondary system, creating an exact mirror image of the primary data in real-time.

In mirroring, any changes made to the primary data are immediately reflected in the mirrored copy, ensuring data consistency and integrity. This synchronization process can occur at the block level, file level, or database level, depending on the specific mirroring implementation.

The primary benefit of mirroring is high availability. By maintaining an up-to-date replica of the primary data, organizations can minimize downtime and ensure uninterrupted access to critical information. In the event of a primary system failure, the secondary mirrored system can seamlessly take over, providing users with continuous access to data and services.

Mirroring also offers data redundancy, which is essential for data protection. In case of data corruption, accidental deletion, or hardware failures affecting the primary system, the mirrored copy provides a reliable backup that can be quickly activated to restore operations. This redundancy enhances data resilience and safeguards against data loss.

Furthermore, mirroring enables rapid recovery times. As the mirrored copy contains an identical version of the primary data, the recovery process can be expedited by switching to the mirrored system. This reduces the downtime associated with data restoration and minimizes the impact on business operations.

### Related terms

* High Availability (HA): The ability of a system or infrastructure to remain operational and accessible with minimal downtime, ensuring continuous service availability.
* Data Redundancy: The practice of creating and maintaining duplicate copies of data to ensure data integrity and protection against data loss.
* Failover: The automatic switching from a primary system to a secondary system in the event of a primary system failure or disruption.
* Data Synchronization: The process of ensuring that multiple copies of data are updated and consistent across different systems or storage devices.
* Replication: The process of creating and maintaining copies of data on separate systems or storage devices for redundancy or distribution purposes.

Mirroring is a critical component of backup and recovery strategies, providing high availability, data redundancy, and rapid recovery capabilities. By continuously replicating data to a secondary system, organizations can ensure business continuity, minimize data loss risks, and achieve quick restoration in case of primary system failures.
