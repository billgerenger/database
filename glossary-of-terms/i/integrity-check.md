# Integrity Check

### Definition

Integrity Check, also known as Data Integrity Check, is a process or mechanism that verifies the consistency, accuracy, and reliability of stored data. It ensures that data remains intact and uncorrupted during storage, transfer, or retrieval operations.

### Explanation

Integrity Checks are performed to detect and prevent data corruption, errors, or unauthorized modifications that can compromise the accuracy and reliability of stored information. By verifying the integrity of data, organizations can ensure the trustworthiness and usability of their critical information assets.

Here's how Integrity Checks typically work:

1. Checksum or Hash Calculation: Integrity Checks often involve the calculation of checksums or hashes, which are unique values computed from the data using mathematical algorithms. These values act as digital fingerprints of the data, representing its content in a condensed form.
2. Comparison: During an Integrity Check, the calculated checksum or hash value is compared against a previously known or expected value. If the values match, the data is considered to be intact and uncorrupted. Any discrepancies or differences indicate potential data corruption or modifications.
3. Verification Mechanisms: Integrity Checks can be performed using various mechanisms, such as cyclic redundancy checks (CRC), message digests (e.g., MD5, SHA-256), or other error-detection codes. These mechanisms provide a way to detect changes in data, even if they are minimal.
4. Periodic or Continuous Checks: Integrity Checks can be performed periodically or continuously, depending on the requirements and criticality of the data. Periodic checks involve validating data at specific intervals, while continuous checks can be implemented in real-time as data is accessed or modified.

Benefits of Integrity Checks include:

* Data Reliability: Integrity Checks help ensure the reliability and trustworthiness of stored data. By verifying data integrity, organizations can have confidence in the accuracy and consistency of their information.
* Early Detection of Data Corruption: Integrity Checks enable the early detection of data corruption or unauthorized modifications. This allows for prompt action to be taken, such as restoring from backups or repairing the affected data.
* Data Validation: Integrity Checks provide a means to validate the integrity of data during storage, transfer, or retrieval processes. This validation ensures that data remains intact and unaltered throughout its lifecycle.
* Compliance and Security: Integrity Checks are often essential for regulatory compliance and security requirements. They help maintain data integrity, preventing unauthorized changes or tampering that could lead to compliance violations or security breaches.

### Related terms

* Data Validation: Data Validation refers to the process of verifying the accuracy, completeness, and consistency of data. Integrity Checks can be considered as a form of data validation, focusing specifically on data integrity.
* Error Detection and Correction (EDAC): Error Detection and Correction mechanisms are techniques used to identify and correct errors or inconsistencies in data. Integrity Checks can be seen as a form of EDAC, focusing on the detection of data corruption or modifications.
* Checksum: A Checksum is a calculated value derived from data using mathematical algorithms. It acts as a unique identifier or digital fingerprint of the data and is commonly used in Integrity Checks.
* Hash Function: A Hash Function is a mathematical algorithm that transforms data into a fixed-size value or hash code. Hash functions are often used in Integrity Checks to calculate hashes for data verification.
* Bit Rot: Bit Rot, also known as data decay or data rot, refers to the gradual decay or corruption of stored data over time. Integrity Checks help detect and prevent bit rot by identifying data inconsistencies or corruption.
