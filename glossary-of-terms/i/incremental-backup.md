# Incremental Backup

### Definition

Incremental Backup is a data backup strategy that involves backing up only the changes or additions made since the last backup, whether it's a full backup or an incremental backup. This approach reduces backup time and storage requirements compared to full backups, making it an efficient way to protect data.

### Explanation

Incremental Backup is a data backup strategy that involves backing up only the changes or additions made since the last backup, whether it's a full backup or an incremental backup. This approach reduces backup time and storage requirements compared to full backups, making it an efficient way to protect data.

Explanation: Incremental Backup focuses on capturing and storing only the data that has changed since the last backup. It relies on a baseline backup, which is typically a full backup that captures the entire dataset initially. Subsequent backups then capture only the changes that have occurred since the last backup, which can be files, folders, or blocks of data.

Here's how Incremental Backup typically works:

1. Baseline Backup: The initial backup is a full backup that captures the entire dataset. This serves as the baseline or starting point for subsequent backups.
2. Incremental Backups: After the baseline backup, incremental backups are performed at regular intervals. These backups capture only the data that has changed or been added since the last backup, whether it's a full backup or an incremental backup.
3. Backup Time and Storage Efficiency: Incremental Backup is efficient in terms of backup time and storage requirements. Since only the changes need to be backed up, the backup process is faster, and less storage space is required compared to performing full backups each time.
4. Restore Process: To restore data from an incremental backup, the baseline backup and subsequent incremental backups are required. The baseline backup is used as the starting point, and then the changes from each incremental backup are applied in chronological order until the desired point-in-time restore is reached.

Benefits of Incremental Backup include:

* Reduced Backup Time: Incremental backups only capture and process the changes made since the last backup, resulting in faster backup times compared to performing full backups each time.
* Lower Storage Requirements: Since only the changes are backed up, Incremental Backup requires less storage space compared to full backups. This is especially beneficial for organizations with large datasets.
* Faster Restore Process: When restoring data, Incremental Backup requires applying the baseline backup and then only the incremental backups containing the specific changes. This process is typically faster than restoring from a single full backup.
* Granular Recovery Options: Incremental backups capture changes at a granular level, allowing for more precise data recovery. Specific files, folders, or blocks of data can be restored without the need to restore the entire dataset.

### Related terms

* Full Backup: A Full Backup is a complete backup of all data in a given dataset or system. It serves as the baseline for subsequent incremental backups.
* Differential Backup: Differential Backup is a backup strategy that captures all changes made since the last full backup. Unlike incremental backups, differential backups do not rely on the last backup point but capture changes relative to the full backup.
* Backup Frequency: Backup Frequency refers to how often backups are performed. In Incremental Backup, the frequency can vary based on organizational requirements and the frequency of data changes.
* Backup Retention: Backup Retention refers to the duration for which backup copies are retained. Incremental backups are often retained for a specific period, allowing for point-in-time restores within that retention window.
* Backup Strategy: Backup Strategy encompasses the overall approach and methodology used for data backups. Incremental Backup is a common strategy used to balance backup time, storage efficiency, and data protection.
* Data Loss Prevention: Data Loss Prevention encompasses strategies and measures implemented to prevent the loss of important data. Incremental Backup is a key component of data loss prevention by regularly capturing and preserving data changes.

It's worth noting that the restore process for Incremental Backup requires all the necessary incremental backups in the correct order. Organizations should maintain a proper backup rotation and ensure the availability of all required backups for successful data restoration.
