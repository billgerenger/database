# Image-based Backup

### Definition

Image-based Backup, also known as System-level Backup or Bare Metal Backup, is a backup method that captures a complete snapshot or image of an entire system, including the operating system, applications, settings, and data. This comprehensive backup approach enables the restoration of the entire system to a previous state in case of data loss, system failures, or disaster recovery scenarios.

### Explanation

Image-based Backup focuses on creating a full and exact replica of a system's state at a specific point in time. It goes beyond traditional file-level backups by capturing not only individual files and folders but also the entire system configuration, operating system files, application settings, and data in a single backup file or image.

Here's how Image-based Backup typically works:

1. System Snapshot: Image-based Backup starts by taking a snapshot or image of the entire system. This includes the operating system, installed applications, configuration settings, user data, and system files.
2. Single Backup File: The snapshot is stored as a single backup file or image. This file contains a complete representation of the system's state at the time of the backup.
3. Block-level Backup: Image-based Backup often utilizes block-level backup technology. It breaks down the system into smaller data blocks, enabling efficient backup and restoration processes by only capturing and storing changed blocks since the previous backup.
4. Full System Restore: In case of data loss, system failures, or disaster recovery scenarios, the image-based backup can be used to restore the entire system to its previous state. This includes the operating system, applications, settings, and data.

Benefits of Image-based Backup include:

* Comprehensive System Protection: Image-based Backup provides comprehensive protection by capturing the entire system's state, including the operating system and installed applications. This ensures the ability to restore the entire system in case of complete system failures or disasters.
* Faster Recovery Time: Since image-based backups contain the entire system's state, the restoration process is faster compared to rebuilding a system from scratch. It eliminates the need for manual reinstallation of the operating system and applications.
* System-level Recovery: Image-based backups enable system-level recovery, allowing organizations to restore a system to a specific point in time. This is valuable in cases where individual files or folders are not sufficient, and the entire system configuration needs to be restored.
* Disaster Recovery Capability: Image-based Backup plays a crucial role in disaster recovery scenarios. It allows for the recovery of systems to a previous state after major disasters or catastrophic events, minimizing downtime and data loss.

### Related terms

* Full Backup: A Full Backup captures a complete copy of all data, files, and configurations in a given dataset or system. Image-based backups often perform full backups to create the initial system image.
* System State: System State refers to the current state of an operating system, including configurations, registries, system files, and other vital components. Image-based Backup captures the system state as part of the backup process.
* Disk Imaging: Disk Imaging is the process of creating a sector-by-sector copy of an entire disk or volume, including all data, partitions, and file systems. Image-based Backup relies on disk imaging to create system-level backups.
* Recovery Point Objective (RPO): RPO defines the maximum acceptable amount of data loss in case of a system failure or data loss event. Image-based Backup with frequent backups can help achieve lower RPOs.
* Bare-Metal Recovery: Bare-Metal Recovery involves restoring an entire system, including the operating system, applications, and data, to a new or repaired hardware environment. Image-based Backup is often used for bare-metal recovery scenarios.

It's important to note that Image-based Backup requires sufficient storage capacity and efficient backup software or tools capable of creating and managing system-level images effectively.
