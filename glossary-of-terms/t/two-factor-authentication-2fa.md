# Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)

### Definition

Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) is a security measure that adds an additional layer of protection to the authentication process by requiring users to provide two different forms of identification. It enhances data security by combining something the user knows (e.g., a password or PIN) with something the user possesses (e.g., a physical token or mobile device).

### Explanation

Two-Factor Authentication works as follows:

1. User Identification: The user provides their initial login credentials, typically a username and password, to initiate the authentication process.
2. Two-Factor Verification: After entering the initial credentials, the user is prompted to provide a second form of identification. This could be a temporary code generated by an authentication app, a physical security token, a fingerprint scan, or a one-time password (OTP) sent via SMS or email.
3. Authentication Completion: Once the second form of identification is provided and verified, access is granted, and the user is authenticated.

The purpose of Two-Factor Authentication is to add an extra layer of security beyond just a password. By requiring a second factor of authentication, even if an attacker manages to obtain or guess the user's password, they would still be unable to access the account without the second form of identification.

Benefits of Two-Factor Authentication include:

1. Enhanced Security: By requiring two different forms of identification, 2FA significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access to user accounts. Even if one factor is compromised, the second factor provides an additional safeguard.
2. Protection Against Credential Theft: With the rise of phishing attacks and data breaches, passwords alone are no longer sufficient to protect accounts. 2FA helps mitigate the risk of account compromise by adding an extra layer of defense.
3. User-Friendly Experience: Many Two-Factor Authentication methods are user-friendly and easy to use. Mobile apps that generate temporary codes or push notifications, for example, provide a seamless and convenient authentication experience.

### Related terms

* Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): A broader term that encompasses any authentication method that requires two or more factors of identification, including Two-Factor Authentication.
* Authentication: The process of verifying the identity of a user or device attempting to access a system or application.
* Password Security: Best practices and measures to ensure the strength, complexity, and protection of passwords.

Two-Factor Authentication is a critical security measure for protecting sensitive data and preventing unauthorized access to accounts. By implementing 2FA, organizations and individuals can significantly enhance their data security posture and mitigate the risk of credential-based attacks.
