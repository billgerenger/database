# Backup and Recovery

### Definition

Backup and recovery refers to the process of creating copies of data or systems in order to protect against data loss, corruption, or system failure, and the process of restoring that data or system to a previous state in the event of a disaster or failure.

### Explanation

The process of backup and recovery involves creating regular backups of data or systems, which can be stored on different types of media such as disk, tape, or cloud storage. Backups can be created using a variety of methods, such as full, incremental, or differential backups. The backups serve as a redundancy measure, protecting data and systems from a variety of risks, such as accidental deletion, hardware or software failure, cyberattacks, or natural disasters.

Recovery involves restoring data or systems from backups or other forms of redundancy, such as failover or replication. The recovery process can vary depending on the type of backup, the storage media, and the nature of the disaster or failure.
