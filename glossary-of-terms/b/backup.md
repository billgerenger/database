# Backup

### Definition

Backup is the process of creating a copy of data or system files and storing it in a separate location to protect against data loss, corruption, or disaster.

### Explanation

Backups can be created on a regular basis, such as daily, weekly, or monthly, depending on the organization's data retention policies and recovery objectives. Backups can be created at different levels of granularity, such as file-level, system-level, or application-level, depending on the type and importance of the data.

Backups can be stored on various types of media, such as disk-based storage, tape-based storage, or cloud-based storage. Backups can also be replicated to a secondary site or location to provide additional protection against data loss or disaster.

The backup process involves several steps, including data selection, data compression, data encryption, and data transfer. Backup software is used to automate and manage the backup process, allowing administrators to schedule backups, monitor backup status, and configure backup settings.

Backups can be used to restore data or system files to a previous state after a data loss or disaster. Restoration can be performed at different levels of granularity, such as file-level, system-level, or application-level, depending on the type and scope of the data loss.
