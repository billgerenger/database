# Backup as a service

### Definition

Backup as a service (BaaS) is a cloud-based data backup and recovery service that provides customers with a way to back up their data to a remote, cloud-based server over the internet, rather than backing up to a local, on-premises server.

### Explanation

BaaS is a form of cloud computing that enables customers to outsource their data backup and recovery needs to a third-party provider. With BaaS, customers typically pay a monthly or yearly subscription fee to have their data backed up to a cloud-based server maintained by the BaaS provider. The data is typically encrypted before it is transmitted to the cloud, and customers can access and recover their data using a web-based interface or other tools provided by the BaaS provider.

BaaS is particularly useful for organizations that want to ensure the security and reliability of their backups, without having to invest in and maintain their own backup infrastructure. BaaS providers can offer a range of services, such as automated backups, data deduplication, and backup testing and verification.
