# File-Level Backup

### Definition

File-Level Backup, also known as file-level or file-based backup, is a data backup method that focuses on individual files and folders rather than backing up entire systems or disk images. It enables the selective backup and recovery of specific files, providing flexibility and granular control over the backup process.

### Explanation

File-Level Backup operates at the level of individual files and directories, allowing users to choose specific files or folders for backup instead of backing up entire drives or systems. This backup method is commonly used when there is a need to protect important files or when a more granular approach to backup and recovery is required.

Here are some key points about File-Level Backup:

1. Selective backup: With File-Level Backup, users can choose specific files or directories to include in the backup. This enables a more targeted approach, focusing on critical data or specific subsets of files, rather than backing up everything on a system.
2. Granular recovery: File-Level Backup allows for the restoration of individual files or folders from the backup. In the event of data loss or accidental deletion, users can retrieve specific files without having to restore the entire backup set. This provides flexibility and saves time during the recovery process.
3. Flexibility: File-Level Backup is suitable for various scenarios, such as protecting user-generated files, documents, multimedia content, or application-specific files. It allows users to back up and restore files across different storage media and platforms, regardless of the underlying system or application.
4. Storage efficiency: File-Level Backup optimizes storage utilization by backing up only selected files or changed files since the last backup. This helps reduce backup storage requirements compared to full system or image-level backups, where entire disk volumes or partitions are backed up.
5. Backup frequency: File-Level Backup can be performed on a scheduled basis or in response to specific events or changes. Users can define backup intervals that suit their requirements, balancing the frequency of backups with storage considerations and backup windows.

### Related terms

* Full Backup: A backup strategy that involves copying all selected files and folders from the source to the backup destination. Full Backup captures the entire dataset, creating a baseline for data protection.
* Incremental Backup: A backup strategy that captures and stores only the changes made since the last backup, reducing backup time and storage requirements. Incremental backups are often used in conjunction with Full Backups.
* Differential Backup: A backup strategy that captures and stores the changes made since the last Full Backup, providing an intermediate backup point between Full Backups. Differential backups capture all changes since the last Full Backup.
* Backup Set: The collection of files, folders, and data that are selected and included in a backup operation. A backup set can consist of individual files or a group of files and directories.
* Recovery Point: A specific point in time to which data can be restored from a backup. In File-Level Backup, each backup session represents a distinct recovery point for the backed-up files.
* Backup Rotation: The practice of using multiple backup sets and cycling through them in a predefined order. Rotation schemes ensure that backups are retained over time, enabling recovery from different points in time.
* Backup Software: The application or tool used to manage and perform backup operations. Backup software provides features for selecting files, scheduling backups, and managing backup sets.
* File Sync and Share: Services or applications that synchronize files across multiple devices and enable file sharing. File-Level Backup can complement file sync and share solutions by providing an additional layer of data protection.
* Continuous Data Protection (CDP): A backup method that captures and replicates changes to files and data in real-time or near real-time, providing a high level of data protection and minimizing the risk of data loss.
