# Failover

### Definition

Failover refers to the process of automatically or manually switching to a backup system or alternative resource when the primary system or component experiences a failure or becomes unavailable. It ensures continuity of operations and minimizes downtime in the event of a failure.

### Explanation

Failover is a critical component of high availability and disaster recovery strategies. It enables a seamless transition from a failed or unavailable primary system to a backup or redundant system, ensuring uninterrupted access to services, applications, or resources.

Here are some key points about Failover:

1. Redundancy: Failover typically involves having redundant systems, components, or resources that are capable of taking over the workload when the primary system fails. These redundant systems may be on standby, ready to activate when needed, or they may be actively processing and replicating data in real-time.
2. Automatic or manual: Failover can be automatic, where a system or infrastructure monitoring mechanism detects a failure and triggers the failover process automatically. Alternatively, it can be manually initiated by system administrators or operators when they determine that a failover is necessary.
3. Minimal downtime: The primary objective of Failover is to minimize or eliminate downtime. By quickly switching to a backup system, users can continue their operations without experiencing significant interruptions or loss of access to critical resources.
4. Load balancing: In some cases, Failover is closely tied to load balancing mechanisms, where multiple systems are actively handling workloads simultaneously. If one system fails, the load is automatically distributed to the remaining systems to ensure uninterrupted service.
5. Failback: Once the primary system is restored or becomes available again, Failover systems can be switched back to the primary system through a process known as Failback. This allows the primary system to resume its normal operation and prepares the Failover systems for future failures.

### Related terms

* High Availability (HA): A design approach that aims to minimize downtime and ensure continuous access to services or resources. Failover is a key component of achieving high availability.
* Disaster Recovery (DR): A comprehensive strategy and set of processes for recovering from major disruptions or catastrophic events that render the primary system or infrastructure inoperable. Failover is often part of the broader disaster recovery plan.
* Redundancy: The presence of duplicate systems, components, or resources that are available to take over when the primary system fails. Redundancy enhances reliability and supports failover capabilities.
* Automatic Failover: A failover process that is triggered automatically by system monitoring mechanisms or failure detection systems without the need for manual intervention.
* Manual Failover: A failover process that is initiated and executed by system administrators or operators based on their judgment and assessment of the situation.
* Failover Testing: The practice of simulating failover scenarios and verifying the effectiveness of failover mechanisms and processes. Failover testing helps ensure the readiness and reliability of the failover capabilities.
* Recovery Time Objective (RTO): The targeted duration within which operations should be restored following a failure or disruption. Failover plays a crucial role in achieving shorter RTOs.
* Recovery Point Objective (RPO): The maximum tolerable amount of data loss measured in time. Failover mechanisms and replication technologies contribute to achieving shorter RPOs.
* Business Continuity: The ability of an organization to continue its critical operations and services, often with the help of failover and disaster recovery measures, in the face of disruptions or disasters.
