# Physical Backup

### Definition

Physical backup refers to the process of creating duplicate copies of data in physical formats, such as tapes, external hard drives, or optical media, for the purpose of data protection and offline storage.

### Explanation

Physical backup plays a crucial role in data protection strategies by providing an additional layer of security and redundancy for critical data. Here are key aspects and benefits of physical backup:

1. Offline Data Storage: Physical backup involves storing data copies in offline storage media, such as tapes or external drives. This offline storage ensures that the backup data is isolated from the production environment, protecting it from online threats such as malware, ransomware, or unauthorized access. Offline storage also provides protection against natural disasters or catastrophic events that may impact the primary data storage.
2. Data Redundancy: By creating physical backups, organizations ensure the existence of multiple copies of their data. This redundancy helps safeguard against data loss in case of hardware failures, data corruption, or other unforeseen issues. Having physical backups allows for quick data recovery and minimizes downtime in the event of data loss or system failures.
3. Long-Term Data Retention: Physical backups are often used for long-term data retention purposes. Organizations may create periodic backups and store them in secure offsite locations, ensuring the availability of historical data for compliance, regulatory requirements, or disaster recovery purposes. Physical backups provide a reliable and cost-effective solution for retaining data over extended periods.
4. Data Portability: Physical backup media, such as tapes or external drives, offer the advantage of easy data portability. These backup copies can be easily transported to different locations or accessed on different systems, facilitating data recovery and restoration processes. Data portability ensures flexibility and convenience in managing backup and recovery operations.

### Related terms

* Online Backup: Backup method that involves storing data copies in remote or cloud-based storage repositories.
* Offsite Backup: Storing backup copies in an external location separate from the primary data center for added data protection.
* Backup Retention: The duration for which backup copies are retained before being overwritten or purged.
* Backup Rotation: The practice of periodically replacing older backups with newer ones to ensure a consistent and up-to-date backup set.

Physical backup provides an essential layer of data protection by creating duplicate copies of critical data in physical formats. By storing backups offline, organizations can safeguard against online threats, ensure data redundancy, and retain data for extended periods. Leveraging physical backup strategies enhances data resilience, enables reliable data recovery, and helps organizations meet their data protection objectives.
