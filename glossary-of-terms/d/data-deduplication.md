# Data Deduplication

### Definition

Data deduplication is a technique used to eliminate redundant data within a storage or backup system. It involves identifying and removing duplicate data segments, storing only one instance of each segment, and creating references to that instance for subsequent occurrences.

### Explanation

Data deduplication is designed to reduce storage space requirements by eliminating redundant data. It works by breaking data into small segments and comparing them to identify duplicates. When a duplicate segment is found, instead of storing a new copy, a reference is created to the existing stored segment.

Deduplication can be performed at various levels, such as file-level deduplication, block-level deduplication, or byte-level deduplication. The level of granularity depends on the deduplication technique and the data being processed. Deduplication can be performed inline (during the backup or storage process), post-process (after the backup or storage process), or as a combination of both.

Data deduplication offers several benefits, including reduced storage costs, improved backup and restore speeds, and efficient use of network bandwidth. It is particularly effective for environments with large amounts of redundant data, such as virtualized environments or backup systems with multiple copies of the same data.
