# Disk-to-Disk (D2D) Backup

### Definition

Disk-to-Disk (D2D) backup is a data backup method that involves copying and storing data from a source disk directly to a target disk, without intermediate tape or other removable media. It provides faster backup and restore speeds compared to traditional tape-based backup methods.

### Explanation

In a D2D backup scenario, data is read from the source disk (such as a primary storage system or server) and written directly to the target disk, which can be a dedicated disk array, a network-attached storage (NAS) device, or a cloud storage system. This approach eliminates the need for tape drives and media, reducing backup and restore times.

D2D backup offers several advantages over tape-based backup methods. It provides faster backup and restore speeds, as disk-based systems can read and write data more quickly than tape drives. Additionally, disk-based backups offer random access to data, enabling faster data recovery compared to sequential access in tape-based backups.

D2D backup also simplifies backup management and reduces the risk of data loss. With disk-based backups, there is no need to manage and track physical tape cartridges, and the risk of tape failure or damage is eliminated. Disk-based backups can also be easily replicated to remote locations for offsite data protection and disaster recovery purposes.
