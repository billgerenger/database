# What are the downsides of Backblaze?

While Backblaze is a popular and widely used cloud backup service, it's important to consider some of its downsides and limitations before making a decision. Here are a few aspects to keep in mind:

1. Limited File Versioning: Backblaze keeps file versions for only 30 days. This means that if you accidentally modify or delete a file, and you realize it after the 30-day period, it may not be possible to recover the previous version from Backblaze. This limitation can be a concern for users who require longer-term file versioning for data recovery purposes.
2. Lack of External Drive Continuous Backup: Backblaze does not offer continuous backup for external drives. While it does provide backup for external drives, the backup process requires regular reconnection of the external drive to ensure data is backed up. This can be inconvenient for users who frequently disconnect and reconnect external drives or rely heavily on external storage devices.
3. No Network or NAS Device Backup: Backblaze is primarily designed for individual users and does not offer backup support for network-attached storage (NAS) devices. If you have important data stored on a NAS device, Backblaze may not be the ideal solution for backing up that specific data source.
4. Limited Backup Customization: Backblaze focuses on simplicity and ease of use, which means it may not offer the same level of backup customization as some other backup solutions. Advanced users who require granular control over backup settings and file exclusions may find Backblaze's configuration options somewhat limited.
5. Lack of File Sync and Collaboration Features: Backblaze primarily functions as a backup service, emphasizing data protection and recovery. However, it does not offer file synchronization or collaboration features commonly found in other cloud storage and backup solutions. If you require real-time file syncing across multiple devices or collaborative file sharing capabilities, Backblaze may not fulfill those specific needs.
6. Internet Bandwidth Limitations: Backblaze relies on internet connectivity to back up and restore data. If you have a large amount of data to back up or restore, it can consume significant internet bandwidth and potentially impact other online activities. Users with limited or slow internet connections may experience longer backup or restore times.
7. Lack of Hybrid Backup Options: Backblaze focuses on cloud-based backup and does not provide hybrid backup options that integrate with on-premises backup solutions. Organizations that require a hybrid backup approach, combining cloud and local backups, may need to consider alternative solutions that offer more comprehensive hybrid backup capabilities.

It's essential to assess these downsides of Backblaze in the context of your specific requirements and preferences. While Backblaze may have certain limitations, it still offers reliable cloud backup services for individual users and small businesses. Consider evaluating your backup needs, comparing different backup solutions, and weighing the pros and cons to determine the best fit for your data protection strategy.
