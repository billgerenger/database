# What is VMware considered backup?

VMware offers a comprehensive backup solution called "VMware vSphere Data Protection" (VDP) designed specifically for virtualized environments. VDP is a backup and recovery tool integrated within the VMware ecosystem, providing robust data protection for virtual machines (VMs).

With VMware vSphere Data Protection, administrators can perform backups at the image level, capturing the entire VM configuration, applications, and data. This approach ensures the preservation of VMs as a whole, allowing for efficient backup and recovery processes.

VMware's backup solution supports various backup strategies, including full backups and incremental backups. Full backups capture the complete VM image, while incremental backups focus on backing up only the changes made since the last backup. This approach minimizes storage requirements and optimizes backup performance.

By leveraging VMware's built-in backup capabilities, organizations can effectively protect their virtualized infrastructure and ensure the recoverability of their VMs in case of data loss, system failures, or disasters. VMware's approach to backup emphasizes the importance of data protection within virtualized environments, addressing the unique challenges associated with VM backup and recovery.

Utilizing VMware's backup solution, organizations can streamline their data protection processes, benefit from the integration with the VMware ecosystem, and ensure the continuity of their virtualized environments. VMware's commitment to providing a reliable backup solution underscores its dedication to helping organizations safeguard their critical data and maintain operational resilience.
