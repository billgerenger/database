# What should an IT disaster recovery plan include?

An IT disaster recovery plan is a comprehensive framework that outlines the strategies, procedures, and actions required to recover IT systems and infrastructure following a disruptive event. While specific plans may vary based on organizational needs, industry regulations, and the nature of IT operations, there are several essential components that every IT disaster recovery plan should include:

1. Risk Assessment and Business Impact Analysis: A thorough assessment of potential risks and their impact on business operations is crucial. Identify potential threats, vulnerabilities, and the criticality of IT systems and data. This analysis helps prioritize recovery efforts and allocate resources effectively.
2. Recovery Objectives: Define recovery objectives, including Recovery Point Objective (RPO) and Recovery Time Objective (RTO). RPO determines the maximum acceptable data loss, while RTO sets the desired timeframe for systems and services to be restored. These metrics guide the development of recovery strategies.
3. Emergency Response Procedures: Establish clear procedures for initial response and immediate actions during a disaster. This includes communication protocols, escalation paths, and incident response roles and responsibilities. Define who should be contacted, how to notify stakeholders, and how to activate the disaster recovery plan.
4. Data Backup and Recovery: Define backup procedures, including frequency, storage locations, and backup media. Specify the process for data restoration, verifying data integrity, and performing recovery tests. Consider both onsite and offsite backup solutions to ensure data availability in various scenarios.
5. Recovery Strategies: Develop recovery strategies based on the RPO and RTO. This includes determining whether to restore systems from backups, replicate systems to alternate locations, or use cloud-based recovery options. Document step-by-step procedures for each strategy, ensuring clarity and ease of execution.
6. Infrastructure and System Recovery: Outline the steps necessary to recover IT infrastructure components, such as servers, networks, databases, and applications. Specify the order of recovery, dependencies between systems, and any special considerations for restoring different components.
7. Communication and Stakeholder Management: Establish communication plans to keep stakeholders informed during a disaster. Identify key contact points, communication channels, and methods for delivering status updates. This includes internal communication with employees, external communication with customers and partners, and coordination with relevant authorities if necessary.
8. Testing and Maintenance: Regularly test the IT disaster recovery plan through simulations and exercises to validate its effectiveness. Identify gaps and areas for improvement, and update the plan accordingly. Keep documentation up to date, including contact lists, system inventories, and recovery procedures.
9. Training and Awareness: Ensure that employees involved in disaster recovery are trained on their roles and responsibilities. Provide ongoing training and awareness programs to keep staff informed about the plan, their duties, and any updates or changes.
10. Plan Review and Governance: Regularly review and update the IT disaster recovery plan to align with changing business needs, technological advancements, and regulatory requirements. Establish a governance framework to ensure plan compliance, accountability, and oversight.

An effective IT disaster recovery plan should be regularly reviewed, tested, and updated to reflect evolving risks, technology advancements, and organizational changes. By including these essential components, organizations can enhance their preparedness to mitigate the impact of IT disruptions and maintain critical business operations during times of crisis.
