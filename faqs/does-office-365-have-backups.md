# Does Office 365 have backups?

Microsoft 365 (formerly known as Office 365) is a popular cloud-based productivity suite that offers a range of built-in data protection features, such as retention policies, version history, and recycle bins. However, many users wonder whether Microsoft 365 includes backups. The answer is no - Microsoft 365 does not provide a comprehensive backup solution. While the built-in data protection features can offer some level of protection, they may not be sufficient for all scenarios, such as data loss due to hacking or service outages.

To ensure that their data is fully protected, Microsoft recommends that users implement third-party backup tools. These tools can provide additional features, such as the ability to back up data to a separate location, automate backups, and test backup data to ensure it can be easily restored. Some popular third-party backup tools for Microsoft 365 include NAKIVO, Acronis and Veeam.

While Microsoft 365 provides some built-in data protection features, it does not include backups. It's important for users to implement additional measures to protect their data, such as using third-party backup tools, to ensure that their data is fully protected and easily recoverable in case of data loss.
