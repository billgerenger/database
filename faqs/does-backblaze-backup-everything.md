# Does Backblaze backup everything?

Backblaze is a cloud backup service that aims to provide comprehensive data protection for individual users and businesses. While Backblaze offers broad backup coverage, it's important to understand the specifics of what is included and excluded from its backup scope. Here's an overview:

What Backblaze Includes in Backup:

1. User Data: Backblaze backs up user data, including documents, photos, videos, music, and other personal files. It scans your computer or designated backup folders and includes these files in the backup process.
2. External Drives: Backblaze supports backup for external hard drives, including USB drives and external storage devices connected to your computer. It includes files stored on external drives as part of the backup set.
3. Network-Attached Storage (NAS): Backblaze extends its backup coverage to NAS devices for business users through its Backblaze B2 Cloud Storage service. It allows NAS devices to back up data directly to Backblaze B2, providing an off-site backup option.

What Backblaze Excludes from Backup:

1. Operating System and Applications: Backblaze does not back up the operating system (OS) or installed applications. It focuses on user-generated data and personal files rather than system files or software installations. System files and applications can be reinstalled from their original sources if needed.
2. Temporary Files and Cache: Backblaze excludes temporary files, cache files, and other temporary system data from backup. These files are typically non-essential and can be regenerated or recovered through other means.
3. System Files and System State: Backblaze does not back up system-level files, configurations, or the system state. This includes system settings, registry data, and other operating system-specific information.
4. Network Drives and Shared Storage: Backblaze does not directly support backing up network drives or shared storage devices. It primarily focuses on local storage connected to the computer on which the Backblaze software is installed.
5. Certain File Types and File Sizes: Backblaze excludes certain file types by default, such as virtual machine disk files (e.g., VMDK, VHD), system backups created by other software, and files larger than 5 TB. However, users can manually adjust file inclusion and exclusion settings through Backblaze preferences.

It's important to review Backblaze's documentation and ensure that the files and data you want to back up fall within its supported scope. Understanding what Backblaze includes and excludes helps you make informed decisions about your data protection strategy and consider alternative backup solutions if specific file types or system-level backups are critical to your needs.
